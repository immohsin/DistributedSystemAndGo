This project is based on one the famous Distributed System course.
The goal is to have a better understanding of mainstream distributed system concept and have a hands-on experience with it.
The project is broken down into many phases and I will update my current progress in this ReadMe file.

    1. implement Map and Reduce function for Word Count problem     - Pass
    2. implement Master for distributing MapReduce jobs             - InProgress
    3. handle worker failures

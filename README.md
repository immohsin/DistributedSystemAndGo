# DistributedSystemAndGo
A practice Distributed System built in Go 

This project is based on one the famous Distributed System course.
The goal is to have a better understanding of mainstream distributed system concept and have a hands-on experience with it.
The project is broken down into many phases and I will update my current progress in this ReadMe file.

Phase 1:
  Part I:   implement Map and Reduce function for Word Count problem
  Part II:  implement Master for distributing MapReduce jobs
  Part III: handle worker failures
